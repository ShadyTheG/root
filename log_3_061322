Honestly its kind of depressing trying to decide which path to go. I want to eventually start a cyber security 
business, but I also need to make money progressivly and support a family on my way to maintaining that dream...

Currently I am working on The Odin Project and trying to learn Security+ and then Network+ lastly the Pentest+
If I can get those and once I get the first certification one --^ then I can start trying to comfortably apply to
some jobs. I am scared to apply now before having any certifications and then not even get a foot in the door later when I do have it and want to apply again? If that makes sense..? 

Since I do love learning though I am struggling to find my process and discipline to learn... I think my path is
focusing on The Odin Project and memorizing Security+ terms on the side in prep for the test, but I want to be able to make my own website as a resume and to start freelance website building for side money. ALSO because there are so many retarded businesses around here that need their websites and menu information updated that it sickens me...
