Started The Odin Project...
Just learning how to use html and saving version control with Git... So I thought I would start a log
of all the new things I've learned for the day.

I've been able to learn the different headers some of the basic ones as well as bold and italic element tags.
I'm about to learn how to imbed images to the webpage. This hopefully will all seem like basic stuff in the 
future I want it to become second nature. Hopefully I can start my own free lance company.
